    "Over the course you can first check if your setup works, then there is an introduction to Lisp (lesson 1), basics of CRAM and the Bullet Physics simulator (lesson 2), writing a plan for a robot to pick & place objects (lesson 3) and finally, failure handling (lesson 4). Each lesson is it's own .ipynb file, you can see them listed on the left. All of your progress, every piece of code you write, will be saved to your local disk, so you can pick up where you left off whenever you want.\n",

    "Jupyter Notebook consists of text blocks and code blocks. Code blocks have these `[ ]` brackets left of them. If they are empty, they haven't been executed yet. If they got a number, like `[42]` it has been executed. While they are executed, they show an asterisk `[*]`. You shouldn't execute code while another is still being executed. Some processes take a while to get done, e.g. loading the project into the kernel or starting the simulation environment. Just be patient. If it takes unreasonably long, hit the button that looks like *Stop* to kill a process that's still showing `[*]`, and hit it multiple times to kill all other running processes if you missed some. Sometimes it helps to just restart the kernel, or kill the `docker-compose` process from your terminal, outside of Jupyter. Keep in mind, that every time the Lisp kernel is restarted, any global parameters you defined in your last session need to be defined again by executing the code blocks.\n",

Watch out especially for the `-wgl` switch in the arguments for the shortcut of the executable.
