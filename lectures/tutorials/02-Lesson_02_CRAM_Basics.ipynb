    "# Lesson 02 - CRAM Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "CRAM stands for Cognitive Robot Abstract Machine. Today we are working with the CRAM plan-executive, which is a framework for writing high-level procedures for robots. High-level, meaning, the procedures in this framework are agnostic of the underlying platform. They can be executed on different robots (PR2, TiaGo, Pepper, HSR, Boxy, Donbot), in different simulations (Bullet, Unreal, MuJoCo), with different motion planners (Giskard, MoveIt, MoveBase, NaiveKinematics), knowledge representations (KnowRob, RALF, internal heuristics), perception systems (Robosherlock, RoboCudo, sim-based perception)... All of these can be easily exchanged by switching out the process-modules for a specific platform, which is like plugging in a different pair of headphones or connect speakers instead, and still hear the same music. The high-level plan stays the same, the music stays the same, but the target output changes. Our platform today is Bullet Physics, a lightweight simulator, that's tightly coupled into CRAMs geometric reasoning.\n",
